# g3

Rust crate for plane based projective geometric algebra for 3 dimensions aka the Clifford Algebra with signature ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P%28\mathbb{R}^{*}_{3,0,1}%29).

WIP, more info to follow.

## Get Started

This software uses some of Rust experimental feautures like `std_simd` and `fn_traits` so make sure to compile using the nightly release.

```bash
rustup update -- nightly
```
